## üìå 1. Background & Overview 
#### 1.1. Situation
SuperStore is a global retail company with a massive customer base. As the Christmas and New Year holidays approach, the Marketing department wants to launch appreciation campaigns to recognize and retain loyal customers while also converting high-potential customers into loyal ones. Given the large dataset, manual segmentation is no longer feasible. Therefore, a data-driven approach using the RFM model is employed to identify valuable customer segments.

#### 1.2. Complication
- The exponential growth in the volume of customer data has made manual segmentation using Excel no longer feasible. The company requires a systematic, data-driven approach to effectively segment customers
- How to design loyalty and appreciation campaigns that boost revenue and retain high-value customers.
- How to turn promising customers into loyal and profitable customers 

#### 1.3. Question
This analysis was conducted to answer two core business questions:
- How can we build the most effective customer appreciation campaign to maximize revenue during the Christmas and New Year season?
- What is the optimal strategy to convert "Promising" customers into "Loyal" customers?

#### 1.4. Target Audience
Strategy & marketing teams

## 3. RFM Model:
#### 3.1. RFM introduction 
RFM stands for Recency, frequency, and Monetary. RFM segmentation is a scoring technique used to better quantify customer behavior. The RFM model evaluates customer value based on:
- Recency (R): How recently a customer has purchased.
- Frequency (F): How often a customer purchases.
- Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends

#### 3.2. Customer Segmentation & Scoring Criteria
